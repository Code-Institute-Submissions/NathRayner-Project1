Hello!

This page is intended to be a page that is informational based about myself, Nath Rayner.

I have made this page in order to use it as an online CV.

Plans for the website:
This website is to be used as an online CV or contact page for myself. I will update it with projects I'm working on and a fresh CV.

This website will be extremely useful as it will provide any potential employeers with all of my details, a way to get in touch with me and a way to instantly get to see my CV. I plan to eventually make the images on the creative page a bit more responsive, maybe starting smaller, then when clicked give information about the picture and who is in it, also make it downloadable with a watermark.

However for now it's a great starting point to give people access to what I'm currently doing and to get involved!

Troubles:

- At the start of making this project, I decided on having a nice black/grey/white theme, after consulting with my mentor I downloaded and used WAVE for chrome which said it might be an issue for some visually impared users.

- Navbar staying white, working on a fix

- unable to make one of the main pictures disapear on smaller devices

- collapsed nav bar toggler not working as intended

Fixes:
I change the color scheme so that it is more friendly for all users.

Code written:
Some of the code written in this project is borrowed from a lesson via Code Institute - the git repository can be found here "https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/resume-miniproject-bootstrap4"
