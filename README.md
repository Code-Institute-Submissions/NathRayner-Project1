Hello!

This page is intended to be a page that is informational based about myself, Nath Rayner.

I have made this page in order to use it as an online CV.

Troubles:
At the start of making this project, I decided on having a nice black/grey/white theme, after consulting with my mentor I downloaded and used WAVE for chrome which said it might be an issue for some visually impared users.

Fixes:
I change the color scheme so that it is more friendly for all users.
